# Image-Captioning-using-Attention-Mechanism
This problem deals with solving the problem of captioning the images. So for that I used CNN to extract features of the images and LSTM to extract of the features of the captions and combined both of them to create a Encoder-Decoder model. Also used attention which resulted in increase of perplexity score.
Used the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MSCOCO) data set to train and test the model. You can read more about the dataset here: https://cocodataset.org/#home
